# Couch Surfing Social App

## Coding Challenge Completion

This project was completed by Noel Serrato as part of a coding challenge. The challenge requirements were to create a simple web app with basic social capabilities, including:

* A user-centric view where users can see their profile
* A screen for listing mock posts from friends and a detail view of the posts
* Placeholders for good data structures for users, posts, and friends
* Mock API calls and data as needed

## Project Overview

The Couch Surfing Social App is a Next.js application that simulates a basic social network for couch surfers. It includes features such as user profiles, friend lists, and a post feed with detailed post views.

## Development Experience

As a developer, I faced several challenges and learning opportunities while working on this project:

1. **Learning Next.js**: Before starting this project, I had limited experience with Next.js. I spent several hours going through online tutorials and a Next.js 101 guide to familiarize myself with the framework's concepts and best practices.

2. **Data Mapping Issues**: One of the main struggles I encountered was mapping through the friends data. Initially, I had issues with the `friends.map is not a function` error, which required me to refactor my data handling approach.

3. **Error Boundaries**: Implementing error boundaries was another challenge. I had to learn how to properly catch and display errors to enhance the user experience and make the app more robust.

4. **Best Practices**: Throughout the development process, I attempted to incorporate best practices where I saw fit, based on my research and understanding of Next.js and React development.

5. **Navigation Enhancement**: To improve user navigation, I added a breadcrumb component, allowing users to easily understand their location within the app and navigate back to previous pages.

## Future Features

If given more time, some potential features to enhance the app could include:

1. Adding a comment section to the post detail page
2. Implementing user authentication and login functionality
3. Developing a more robust backend with a real database
4. Enhancing the user interface with more interactive elements
5. Implementing real-time updates for posts and comments

## Conclusion

This project was a valuable learning experience in working with Next.js and developing a social media-style application. Despite the challenges, I hopefully was able to meet the core requirements of the coding challenge, while gaining insights into the Next.js framework.
